    "text": "Data: Two Time Series, One Question\nWe need two things: electricity prices and temperature. The DE-LU day-ahead price represents the marginal cost of electricity in the German-Luxembourg bidding zone—the price at which the last unit of demand is satisfied. It’s a market signal that reflects supply-demand balance in real-time.\nGerman temperature data provides the heatwave signal. We use Germany because it’s the dominant market in the DE-LU zone, and temperature is the primary driver of cooling demand. The data spans 2015-2020, capturing multiple summers with varying heatwave intensity.\nThe challenge is temporal alignment: prices are hourly, heatwaves are daily phenomena. We need to bridge this gap—flagging heatwave days, then attributing that flag to all hours within those days. This is a modeling choice: we’re assuming that if a day is a heatwave day, all hours within it are “heatwave hours,” even though nighttime hours might be cooler."

    "text": "Heatwave Definition: A Threshold with Consequences\nThe definition is simple: daily maximum temperature ≥ 30°C for at least 3 consecutive days. But this simplicity masks complexity. Why 30°C? Why 3 days? These choices determine which events get flagged, which get ignored, and ultimately what patterns we observe in the price data.\nThe 30°C threshold is arbitrary but meaningful. In Germany, 30°C represents a temperature where cooling demand becomes significant. Below this, natural ventilation and shading might suffice. Above this, active cooling (air conditioning) becomes necessary, driving electricity demand. The 3-day minimum filters out brief heat spikes, focusing on sustained events that have cumulative impacts on both demand (building heat storage) and supply (thermal plant efficiency degradation).\nAlternative definitions exist: percentile-based (e.g., 95th percentile of summer temperatures), regionalized (different thresholds for different regions), or impact-based (thresholds tied to actual cooling degree days). Each would produce a different set of flagged days, potentially revealing different price patterns. The point isn’t to find the “correct” definition—it’s to make the choice explicit and trace its implications."

Notice the clustering: heatwaves don’t occur in isolation. They cluster in time, creating multi-week periods of elevated stress. The first visualization isolates temperature, showing the heatwave signal clearly—days that exceed 30°C for three or more consecutive days.\nThis temporal clustering matters. A single hot day might cause a price spike, but sustained heatwaves create cumulative effects: building heat storage saturates (requiring more cooling), thermal plants lose efficiency over time, and grid operators face sustained stress rather than brief spikes.

This is descriptive, not causal. Prices could be spiking for other reasons—renewable generation shortfalls, plant outages, cross-border flow constraints. But the visual correlation is suggestive: when heatwaves occur, prices tend to be elevated.\nThe dashed temperature line shows the underlying driver.

Peak hours matter because that’s when cooling demand is highest and when price formation is most sensitive to marginal units.\nWhat we typically observe: the heatwave distribution is shifted right (higher prices on average) and has a fatter right tail (more extreme price spikes). The mean difference quantifies the “heatwave premium”—the average price increase during heatwave periods. But the tail matters more: extreme price spikes during heatwaves can be orders of magnitude higher than normal prices, creating financial stress for consumers and opportunities for generators.\nThe statistical summary provides the numbers: mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles for both distributions. The difference in means tells us about average impact. The difference in 95th percentiles tells us about tail risk. Both matter, but for different purposes: average impact affects long-term costs, tail risk affects system resilience and financial planning.\n\nif merged.empty:\n    print(\"No data available for analysis.\")\n    summary = pd.DataFrame()\nelse:\npeak = merged[(merged[\"hour\"] &gt;= 8) & (merged[\"hour\"] &lt;= 20)].copy()\n\nhw = peak[peak[\"is_heatwave_day\"]]\nnormal = peak[~peak[\"is_heatwave_day\"]]\n\nsummary = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"normal_peak_hours\": normal[\"price_eur_mwh\"].describe(),\n    \"heatwave_peak_hours\": hw[\"price_eur_mwh\"].describe(),\n})\n    print(summary)\n\n\n  Cell In[11], line 5\n    peak = merged[(merged[\"hour\"] &gt;= 8) & (merged[\"hour\"] &lt;= 20)].copy()\n    ^\nIndentationError: expected an indented block after 'else' statement on line 4\n\n\n\n\n\nif merged.empty:\n    print(\"No data available for visualization.\")\nelse:\n    peak = merged[(merged[\"hour\"] &gt;= 8) & (merged[\"hour\"] &lt;= 20)].copy()\n    hw = peak[peak[\"is_heatwave_day\"]]\n    normal = peak[~peak[\"is_heatwave_day\"]]\n    \n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))\n\n    ax.hist(normal[\"price_eur_mwh\"], bins=60, alpha=0.6, density=True, label=\"Normal days (peak hours)\")\n    ax.hist(hw[\"price_eur_mwh\"],     bins=60, alpha=0.6, density=True, label=\"Heatwave days (peak hours)\")\n\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Day-ahead price (EUR/MWh)\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Density\")\n    ax.set_title(\"DE-LU prices: heatwave vs normal days (2015–2019, peak hours)\")\n    ax.legend()\n    plt.show()"

    "text": "Limitations and Extensions: What This Analysis Doesn’t Tell Us\nThis analysis is intentionally limited. It’s descriptive, not causal. We observe that prices are higher during heatwaves, but we don’t claim heatwaves cause those higher prices. Too many confounding factors exist: renewable generation (solar output is high during heatwaves, potentially offsetting demand), plant outages (thermal plants are more likely to fail during heat stress), cross-border flows (neighboring countries also face heatwaves), and fuel prices (which drive marginal costs).\nTo establish causality, we’d need an identification strategy: perhaps exploiting spatial variation (heatwaves in one region but not another), temporal variation (comparing similar days with and without heatwaves), or instrumental variables (using temperature as an instrument for cooling demand). This is beyond the scope of this note.\nNatural extensions include: - Alternative heatwave definitions: Percentile-based thresholds that adapt to regional climate, or impact-based definitions tied to actual cooling degree days - Multivariate analysis: Adding load, renewable generation, and plant availability as covariates to control for confounding factors - Multi-year stability: Do these patterns hold across different summers? Are heatwave impacts getting stronger over time (suggesting increasing system stress)? - Spatial analysis: Do heatwaves in different regions have different price impacts? Does transmission capacity matter?\nThe value of this analysis isn’t in its completeness—it’s in its transparency. Every choice is explicit, every assumption is visible, and the pipeline is inspectable. This makes it a foundation for more sophisticated analysis, not an endpoint.\n\nRelated\n\nRisk Modelling Part 2: Data - Data sources for climate risk"

Synthetic data generation here serves two purposes: it provides a controlled environment to test methods, and it demonstrates how realistic climate variability can emerge from relatively simple stochastic processes. The data spans 24 years (2000-2023) with daily resolution, capturing temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure—three variables that interact in complex ways.\nThe synthetic generation incorporates: - Seasonal cycles (annual temperature variation, precipitation patterns) - Inter-annual variability (year-to-year fluctuations) - Cross-variable dependencies (temperature-precipitation relationships) - Autocorrelation (weather persistence over days)\nThis isn’t “fake data” in the pejorative sense—it’s a generative model that captures the statistical structure of real climate systems.

    "text": "Defining the Extreme: Operational Thresholds\nWhat counts as “extreme” is not a question with a single answer. It’s a modeling choice with real consequences. We use the 95th percentile threshold—meaning 5% of days exceed this value—but this is arbitrary. A heatwave that’s extreme in one region might be normal in another. A 3-day minimum duration filters out single-day spikes, focusing on sustained events that have greater impact.\nThe choice of method matters: - Percentile-based: Relative to the local distribution (adapts to regional climate) - Absolute thresholds: Fixed values (e.g., 30°C) that ignore local context - Anomaly-based: Deviations from expected seasonal patterns\nHere, we use percentile thresholds because they’re scale-invariant and adapt to the data’s inherent variability.

    "section": "Temporal Patterns: When Extremes Occur",
    "text": "Temporal Patterns: When Extremes Occur\nThe timeline visualization reveals something crucial: extreme events are not uniformly distributed. They cluster in time, creating periods of elevated risk. The temperature extremes show clear seasonal patterns—heatwaves in summer, cold snaps in winter—but also reveal inter-annual variability. Some years are quiet; others are punctuated by multiple extreme events.\nThis temporal clustering has implications for risk assessment. If extremes were independent random events, we could model them with simple Poisson processes. But they’re not. They exhibit persistence (heatwaves last multiple days) and clustering (extreme years contain multiple extreme events). This means risk is not constant—it’s time-varying and state-dependent.\nThe visualization also shows the relationship between variables. Notice how extreme precipitation events sometimes coincide with temperature extremes (convective storms during heatwaves), and sometimes don’t (frontal systems during cooler periods). This co-occurrence—or lack thereof—matters for compound risk assessment.\n\n# Create timeline visualization with extreme events highlighted\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(14, 10), sharex=True)\n\n# Temperature with extreme events\nax1 = axes[0]\nax1.plot(climate_data['datetime_utc'], climate_data['temperature_c'], \n         color='#2c3e50', alpha=0.6, linewidth=0.8, label='Temperature')\nax1.scatter(climate_data[climate_data['is_extreme']]['datetime_utc'],\n           climate_data[climate_data['is_extreme']]['temperature_c'],\n           c='#e74c3c', s=30, alpha=0.7, label='Extreme Events', zorder=5)\nax1.axhline(y=np.percentile(climate_data['temperature_c'], 95), \n           color='#c0392b', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7, label='95th Percentile')\nax1.set_ylabel('Temperature (°C)', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax1.set_title('Temperature Time Series with Extreme Events Highlighted', \n              fontsize=13, fontweight='bold', pad=10)\nax1.legend(loc='upper left', fontsize=9)\nax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n\n# Precipitation with extreme events\nax2 = axes[1]\nax2.plot(climate_data['datetime_utc'], climate_data['precipitation_mm'], \n         color='#3498db', alpha=0.6, linewidth=0.8, label='Precipitation')\nprecip_extremes = climate_data[climate_data['precipitation_mm'] &gt;= \n                               np.percentile(climate_data['precipitation_mm'], 95)]\nax2.scatter(precip_extremes['datetime_utc'], precip_extremes['precipitation_mm'],\n           c='#2980b9', s=30, alpha=0.7, label='Extreme Events', zorder=5)\nax2.axhline(y=np.percentile(climate_data['precipitation_mm'], 95), \n           color='#21618c', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7, label='95th Percentile')\nax2.set_ylabel('Precipitation (mm)', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax2.set_title('Precipitation Time Series with Extreme Events Highlighted', \n              fontsize=13, fontweight='bold', pad=10)\nax2.legend(loc='upper left', fontsize=9)\nax2.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n\n# Pressure\nax3 = axes[2]\nax3.plot(climate_data['datetime_utc'], climate_data['pressure_hpa'], \n         color='#7f8c8d', alpha=0.6, linewidth=0.8)\nax3.set_ylabel('Pressure (hPa)', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax3.set_xlabel('Date', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax3.set_title('Atmospheric Pressure Time Series', \n              fontsize=13, fontweight='bold', pad=10)\nax3.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"

    "section": "Return Periods: Quantifying Rarity",
    "text": "Return Periods: Quantifying Rarity\nReturn period analysis answers a deceptively simple question: “How often should we expect an event of this magnitude?” A 100-year return period doesn’t mean it happens exactly once per century—it means the annual probability is 1%. Over a 100-year period, there’s a 63% chance of experiencing at least one such event (due to the compounding of probabilities).\nThe two methods shown here capture different aspects of extremes: - Block Maxima (Annual Maxima): Takes the maximum value each year, fits a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Good for understanding the worst-case scenario in any given year. - Peaks Over Threshold: Identifies all values above a threshold, fits a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). More data-efficient, captures multiple extremes per year.\nThe log-scale x-axis is intentional. Return periods follow a power-law relationship—doubling the return period doesn’t double the intensity. The curve flattens, meaning truly catastrophic events (1000-year return periods) are only marginally more intense than 100-year events, but exponentially rarer.\nThis analysis is the foundation of engineering design standards (dams, bridges, flood defenses) and insurance pricing. The “100-year flood” isn’t a prediction—it’s a risk metric.\n\n# Compute return periods for temperature extremes\nreturn_periods_temp = compute_return_periods(\n    climate_data,\n    variable='temperature_c',\n    method='block_maxima',\n    block_size='1Y'\n)\n\nreturn_periods_precip = compute_return_periods(\n    climate_data,\n    variable='precipitation_mm',\n    method='peaks_over_threshold',\n)\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 5))\n\n# Temperature return periods\nax1 = axes[0]\nax1.plot(return_periods_temp['return_period_years'], \n        return_periods_temp['return_value'], \n        marker='o', linewidth=2, markersize=8, color='#e74c3c')\nax1.set_xlabel('Return Period (years)', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax1.set_ylabel('Return Value (°C)', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax1.set_title('Temperature: Return Period Analysis\\n(Annual Maxima Method)', \n              fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')\nax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\nax1.set_xscale('log')\n\n# Precipitation return periods\nax2 = axes[1]\nax2.plot(return_periods_precip['return_period_years'], \n        return_periods_precip['return_value'], \n        marker='o', linewidth=2, markersize=8, color='#3498db')\nax2.set_xlabel('Return Period (years)', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax2.set_ylabel('Return Value (mm)', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax2.set_title('Precipitation: Return Period Analysis\\n(Peaks Over Threshold Method)', \n              fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')\nax2.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\nax2.set_xscale('log')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nprint(\"Return Period Analysis Results:\")\nprint(\"\\nTemperature (Annual Maxima):\")\nprint(return_periods_temp.to_string(index=False))\nprint(\"\\nPrecipitation (Peaks Over Threshold):\")\nprint(return_periods_precip.to_string(index=False))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn Period Analysis Results:\n\nTemperature (Annual Maxima):\n return_period_years  return_value      variable\n                   2     42.794460 temperature_c\n                   5     47.875623 temperature_c\n                  10     50.035892 temperature_c\n                  20     51.623194 temperature_c\n                  50     53.232872 temperature_c\n                 100     54.216806 temperature_c\n                 200     55.062521 temperature_c\n                 500     56.024671 temperature_c\n\nPrecipitation (Peaks Over Threshold):\n return_period_years  return_value         variable\n                   2           NaN precipitation_mm\n                   5           NaN precipitation_mm\n                  10           NaN precipitation_mm\n                  20     11.267369 precipitation_mm\n                  50     15.124830 precipitation_mm\n                 100     20.049680 precipitation_mm\n                 200     27.822761 precipitation_mm\n                 500     45.390184 precipitation_mm"

    "text": "Correlation Structure: When Variables Move Together\nClimate variables don’t exist in isolation. Temperature, precipitation, and pressure are coupled through physical processes. The correlation matrix quantifies these relationships, but the interpretation requires care.\nA negative correlation between temperature and precipitation might seem counterintuitive, but it reflects the physics: high-pressure systems (clear skies, high temperatures) suppress precipitation, while low-pressure systems (clouds, precipitation) moderate temperatures. The strength of these correlations varies by season and region.\nWhy this matters: if variables are correlated, extreme events in one variable are more likely to co-occur with extremes in another. This creates compound risks that simple univariate analysis misses. A heatwave coinciding with low precipitation creates drought stress. A cold snap with high precipitation creates ice storms. The correlation structure tells us which compound events are physically plausible and which are unlikely.\n\n# Compute correlation matrix\ncorr_matrix = analyze_correlations(\n    climate_data,\n    variables=['temperature_c', 'precipitation_mm', 'pressure_hpa']\n)\n\n# Create heatmap\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))\nif HAS_SEABORN:\n    sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, fmt='.3f', cmap='RdBu_r', center=0,\n               square=True, linewidths=1, cbar_kws={\"shrink\": 0.8},\n               vmin=-1, vmax=1, ax=ax)\nelse:\n    im = ax.imshow(corr_matrix.values, cmap='RdBu_r', vmin=-1, vmax=1, aspect='auto')\n    ax.set_xticks(range(len(corr_matrix.columns)))\n    ax.set_yticks(range(len(corr_matrix.index)))\n    ax.set_xticklabels(corr_matrix.columns)\n    ax.set_yticklabels(corr_matrix.index)\n    for i in range(len(corr_matrix.index)):\n        for j in range(len(corr_matrix.columns)):\n            ax.text(j, i, f'{corr_matrix.iloc[i, j]:.3f}', \n                   ha='center', va='center', color='black' if abs(corr_matrix.iloc[i, j]) &lt; 0.5 else 'white')\n    plt.colorbar(im, ax=ax, shrink=0.8)\nax.set_title('Climate Variables Correlation Matrix', \n             fontsize=13, fontweight='bold', pad=15)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nprint(\"\\nCorrelation Matrix:\")\nprint(corr_matrix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Matrix:\n                  temperature_c  precipitation_mm  pressure_hpa\ntemperature_c          1.000000         -0.196128     -0.661777\nprecipitation_mm      -0.196128          1.000000      0.139706\npressure_hpa          -0.661777          0.139706      1.000000"

    "text": "Event Typology: Clustering Extreme Events\nNot all extreme events are the same. Hierarchical clustering groups events by their multi-variable signatures, revealing distinct “types” of extremes. One cluster might represent “dry heatwaves” (high temperature, low precipitation, high pressure), while another represents “humid heatwaves” (high temperature, high precipitation, low pressure).\nThis typology matters because different event types have different impacts. A dry heatwave increases wildfire risk and water stress. A humid heatwave increases heat stress on humans (reduced evaporative cooling) and can trigger convective storms. The clustering analysis transforms a collection of individual events into a taxonomy of risk scenarios.\nThe cluster characteristics plot shows the mean conditions for each event type.

    "text": "Intensity Distribution: The Shape of Extremes\nThe distribution of extreme event intensities reveals something important: extremes themselves have structure. They’re not uniformly distributed—there are “moderate extremes” and “extreme extremes.” The histogram shows a right-skewed distribution, meaning most extreme events are relatively mild (just above the threshold), while truly catastrophic events are rare.\nThe box plots by cluster show that different event types have different intensity distributions. Some clusters have tight distributions (consistent intensity), while others are highly variable. This heterogeneity matters for risk assessment: if you’re planning for the “typical extreme,” you’ll be underprepared for the tail events.\nThe median being lower than the mean indicates positive skew—the distribution has a long right tail. This is characteristic of extreme value distributions and reflects the physics: there’s a lower bound (you can’t have negative heat), but no upper bound (temperatures can theoretically get arbitrarily high, though practically limited by energy balance).\n\n# Analyze distribution of extreme event intensities\nextreme_events = climate_data[climate_data['is_extreme']].copy()\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 5))\n\n# Histogram of extreme intensities\nax1 = axes[0]\nax1.hist(extreme_events['extreme_intensity'], bins=30, color='#e74c3c', \n        alpha=0.7, edgecolor='black', linewidth=1.2)\nax1.axvline(extreme_events['extreme_intensity'].mean(), \n           color='#c0392b', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, \n           label=f\"Mean: {extreme_events['extreme_intensity'].mean():.2f}°C\")\nax1.axvline(extreme_events['extreme_intensity'].median(), \n           color='#8e44ad', linestyle='--', linewidth=2,\n           label=f\"Median: {extreme_events['extreme_intensity'].median():.2f}°C\")\nax1.set_xlabel('Extreme Intensity (°C above threshold)', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax1.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax1.set_title('Distribution of Extreme Event Intensities', \n              fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')\nax1.legend(fontsize=9)\nax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3, axis='y')\n\n# Box plot by cluster\nax2 = axes[1]\n# Get unique cluster IDs (excluding 0) and filter out empty clusters\nunique_clusters = sorted([i for i in extreme_events['extreme_cluster'].unique() if i &gt; 0])\ncluster_data = []\ncluster_labels = []\nfor i in unique_clusters:\n    data = extreme_events[extreme_events['extreme_cluster'] == i]['extreme_intensity'].values\n    if len(data) &gt; 0:  # Only include clusters with data\n        cluster_data.append(data)\n        cluster_labels.append(str(i))\n\n# Only plot if we have data\nif len(cluster_data) &gt; 0:\n    bp = ax2.boxplot(cluster_data, labels=cluster_labels,\n                    patch_artist=True, showmeans=True)\n    for patch in bp['boxes']:\n        patch.set_facecolor('#e74c3c')\n        patch.set_alpha(0.7)\nelse:\n    ax2.text(0.5, 0.5, 'No cluster data available', \n            ha='center', va='center', transform=ax2.transAxes)\nax2.set_xlabel('Cluster ID', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax2.set_ylabel('Extreme Intensity (°C above threshold)', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')\nax2.set_title('Extreme Intensity Distribution by Cluster', \n              fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')\nax2.grid(True, alpha=0.3, axis='y')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nprint(\"\\nExtreme Event Intensity Statistics:\")\nprint(extreme_events['extreme_intensity'].describe())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtreme Event Intensity Statistics:\ncount    439.000000\nmean       8.338522\nstd       22.503147\nmin        0.000094\n25%        1.083130\n50%        2.890158\n75%        5.935226\nmax      304.825627\nName: extreme_intensity, dtype: float64"
