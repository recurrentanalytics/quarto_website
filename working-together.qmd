# Working Together

## How I Work

I approach consulting the same way I approach research: with transparency, reproducibility, and explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty.

- **Transparent methods** - You see how the analysis works, not just the results
- **Reproducible analysis** - Code, data, and assumptions are documented and shareable
- **Uncertainty-aware** - Model limitations and assumptions are made explicit, not hidden
- **Intellectual honesty** - I'll tell you what we don't know, not what you want to hear

## What I Take On

I work on problems where:

- **Climate risk** intersects with decision-making (insurance, infrastructure, policy)
- **Quantitative rigor** matters more than reassuring narratives
- **Uncertainty** needs to be understood, not minimized
- **Transparency** is valued over polished presentations
- **Reproducibility** is a requirement, not an afterthought

Typical engagements include:
- Climate risk assessment and modeling
- Parametric insurance trigger design
- Extreme event analysis and characterization
- Energy-climate system interdependencies
- Risk quantification for decision support

## What I Don't Do

- Traditional consulting pitches that oversell certainty
- Black-box models where methodology is hidden
- Analysis optimized for reassurance rather than understanding
- Work where intellectual honesty is secondary to desired outcomes

## Engagement

If you're working on problems that align with this approach, reach out:

- **Email:** [timm.walker@recurrentanalytics.com](mailto:timm.walker@recurrentanalytics.com)

Include a brief description of the problem you're working on, and we can discuss whether it's a good fit.

No sales process. No discovery calls. Just a direct conversation about whether the work aligns.
