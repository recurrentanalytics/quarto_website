This site is a working notebook.

I use it to think in public about climate risk, hazards, and systems under stress.

The notes here are not polished conclusions. They are intermediate objects: models, sketches, assumptions, failures, and partial results.

I am interested in where quantitative methods meet institutional reality — especially where uncertainty, incentives, and governance interact.

I do not treat models as neutral. I treat them as situated tools that encode choices, values, and blind spots.

Clarity matters more than novelty. Reproducibility matters more than rhetoric.

This site is incomplete by design.

<summary>Anti-Manifesto</summary>

This site is not a portfolio.

It does not claim to have answers. It does not promise insight, impact, or innovation.

There is no thought leadership here. No frameworks. No "key takeaways."

I am not trying to build an audience, secure funding, or demonstrate competence.

The work here is not optimised for legibility. It is not designed to reassure.

If something looks unfinished, it probably is. If something looks wrong, it might be.

This site rejects polish as a proxy for rigour.
