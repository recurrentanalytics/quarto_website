This site is a working notebook.

I use it to think in public about climate risk, hazards, and systems under stress.

The notes here are not polished conclusions. They are intermediate objects: models, sketches, assumptions, failures, and partial results.

I am interested in where quantitative methods meet institutional reality — especially where uncertainty, incentives, and governance interact.

I do not treat models as neutral. I treat them as situated tools that encode choices, values, and blind spots.

Clarity matters more than novelty. Reproducibility matters more than rhetoric.

This site is incomplete by design.
