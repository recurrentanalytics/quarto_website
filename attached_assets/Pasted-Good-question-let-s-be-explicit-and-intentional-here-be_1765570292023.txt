Good question — let’s be explicit and intentional here, because this is not a gimmick. It’s a **structural design choice** for your site.

---

## 1. What the *Manifesto Toggle* idea is

The manifesto toggle is a **deliberately optional, collapsible statement of intent** that:

* exists on the site
* is visible, but not forced
* signals *how* to read the site before it signals *what* is on it

Conceptually, it sits between:

* an *academic abstract* (too formal, too narrow), and
* a *personal bio* (too narrative, too soft)

It communicates **epistemic stance**, not credentials.

### Why a toggle?

Because:

* people who want orientation will click it
* people who want content won’t be interrupted
* it avoids performative “About Me” verbosity
* it fits your *lab notebook / working archive* positioning

In short:

> *The manifesto is there for those who care how knowledge is produced.*

## 2. What it should communicate (for *you* specifically)

Given your trajectory (applied climate risk → modelling → research-grade work), the manifesto should:

* make clear this is **not a portfolio of finished answers**
* foreground **process, uncertainty, and iteration**
* bridge policy, modelling, and systems thinking
* signal seriousness without institutional cosplay
* quietly distance you from buzzword consultancies

It should *not*:

* read like LinkedIn
* oversell “impact”
* explain your CV
* sound motivational

## 3. Suggested manifesto text (tight, non-cringey)

Here is a **first-pass canonical version** that matches your tone and positioning. This is text you can actually stand behind.

### Manifesto (toggle content)

> This site is a working notebook.
>
> I use it to think in public about climate risk, hazards, and systems under stress.
>
> The notes here are not polished conclusions. They are intermediate objects: models, sketches, assumptions, failures, and partial results.
>
> I am interested in where quantitative methods meet institutional reality — especially where uncertainty, incentives, and governance interact.
>
> I do not treat models as neutral. I treat them as situated tools that encode choices, values, and blind spots.
>
> Clarity matters more than novelty. Reproducibility matters more than rhetoric.
>
> This site is incomplete by design.

If you want a **slightly more technical / research-facing variant**, here’s an alternative ending:

> Many entries will be provisional, unvalidated, or deliberately narrow.
> They are published to be inspected, revised, or discarded.

## 4. Where it belongs

Best placements (in order):

1. **Home page**, near the top, collapsed by default
2. **About page**, expanded by default
3. Dedicated `manifesto.qmd`, linked from the footer

For now, I recommend **Home page + toggle**, collapsed.

---

## 5. Why this works for your transition

This manifesto quietly:

* signals *research maturity* without claiming authority
* gives evaluators (PhD committees, research groups) a way to read your site
* reassures technical readers that rough edges are intentional
* distances you from “finished-product consulting aesthetics”

It frames the entire site as **process-first, result-later**.

---

## 6. Next refinement (optional)

We can:

* tune the language for a **more academic** or **more poetic** register
* create a **short version** (3 lines only)
* align it explicitly with *Recurrent Analytics* as a concept
* localize variants (EN / DE)

If you want, say:

> “Refine the manifesto for **[audience]**”

and I’ll do a careful second pass.
