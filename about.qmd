I'm Timm Walker. I work at the intersection of **climate risk**, **(re)insurance**, and **data-driven modelling**.  
This site is a **public lab notebook** for the *re:current_analytics* project: small, composable models; clean notes; reproducible code.

## Research Interests

My work focuses on making climate risk quantifiable, transparent, and actionable. Key areas:

- **Hazard Analytics** - Identifying and characterizing climate extremes (heatwaves, floods, droughts)
- **Parametric Triggers** - Designing index-based insurance mechanisms
- **Time-Series Analysis** - Modeling temporal patterns in climate and energy data
- **Energy–Water Systems** - Understanding interdependencies in critical infrastructure
- **Serious Games** - Using game design to explore complex systems (see [Tipping Points](/tipping-points/))
- **Uncertainty Quantification** - Making model limitations explicit and tractable
- **Institutional Reality** - Where quantitative methods meet governance and incentives

## Work

I work on climate / risk analytics, consulting, and public-sector projects. Currently building *re:current_analytics* — an open lab for climate modelling and decision tools.

### Current Projects

- **re:current_analytics** - This lab notebook and associated tools
- **Climate Extremes Explorer** - Interactive analysis of extreme events
- **Heatwave-Price Analysis** - Exploring relationships between temperature and energy markets
- **Tipping Points** - Strategic card game modeling climate–politics interactions
