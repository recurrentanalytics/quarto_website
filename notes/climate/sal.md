**Key Insight:**  
A hot, dry, dust-laden air mass moving off North Africa that can suppress Atlantic hurricane formation by increasing vertical wind shear and stabilizing the atmosphere.

## Core Effects
- Dry air entrainment → disrupts convection
- Increased shear → weakens cyclone organization
- Dust aerosols → affect radiation balance & SST

## Visual Mental Model
SAL = "giant desiccating lid" over the Atlantic basin
