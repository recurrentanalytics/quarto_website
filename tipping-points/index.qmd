# Tipping Points

A strategic card game exploring the intersection of climate science and political systems.

## Overview

*Tipping Points* is a card-based game that models how climate events interact with political and social systems. Players navigate cascading effects, feedback loops, and the challenge of building resilience in the face of uncertainty.

## Design Philosophy

The game is designed to:
- Make abstract climate–politics interactions tangible
- Show how small changes can trigger large-scale transformations
- Explore trade-offs between short-term stability and long-term adaptation
- Model uncertainty and incomplete information
- Bridge the gap between scientific understanding and political decision-making

The design emphasizes **emergent complexity**—simple rules that generate complex, unpredictable outcomes, mirroring real-world climate–politics dynamics.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Systems

1. **Setup**: Each player receives a hand of system cards representing different sectors (energy, agriculture, governance, infrastructure, etc.)

2. **Climate Events**: Draw climate cards that trigger impacts on systems. Events have:
   - **Intensity** (magnitude of the event)
   - **Duration** (how long effects persist)
   - **Scope** (which systems are affected)

3. **Response**: Play system cards to:
   - Build resilience (reduce vulnerability)
   - Adapt (change system structure)
   - Mitigate (prevent future impacts)

4. **Tipping Points**: When thresholds are crossed, tipping point cards activate, creating:
   - Cascading effects across multiple systems
   - Feedback loops (positive or negative)
   - Irreversible state changes

5. **Victory Conditions**: 
   - **Stability Path**: Maintain system stability through multiple climate events
   - **Transformation Path**: Successfully transform systems to be more resilient
   - **Collaboration Path**: Achieve collective goals through coordinated action

### Current Rules Version

*Rules are currently in active development. See [Design Notes](/tipping-points/design-notes/) for latest iterations and playtesting results.*

## Card Types

### Climate Cards

Represent physical climate events and their characteristics:

- **Heatwaves** - Extreme temperature events affecting energy demand, agriculture, health systems
- **Floods** - Water-related disasters impacting infrastructure, communities, agriculture
- **Droughts** - Extended dry periods affecting water systems, agriculture, energy production
- **Sea-Level Rise** - Long-term coastal impacts on infrastructure and communities
- **Extreme Weather** - Storms, hurricanes, and other high-intensity events

Each climate card includes:
- Event description and real-world context
- Affected systems
- Intensity and duration parameters
- Potential cascading effects

### System Cards

Model political, economic, and social systems:

- **Governance** - Political structures, policy-making, institutional capacity
- **Energy** - Power generation, distribution, grid infrastructure
- **Agriculture** - Food production, supply chains, rural communities
- **Infrastructure** - Transportation, water, communications
- **Markets** - Economic systems, financial institutions, trade
- **Communities** - Social networks, local organizations, civil society

System cards have:
- Current state (resilience level, vulnerabilities)
- Response options (adaptation, mitigation, transformation)
- Interconnections with other systems

### Tipping Point Cards

Trigger cascading effects when certain conditions are met:

- **Threshold Crossings** - When system stress exceeds capacity
- **Feedback Loops** - Self-reinforcing or self-limiting dynamics
- **System Transformations** - Fundamental changes to system structure
- **Cascading Failures** - When one system failure triggers others

Tipping point cards change the game state permanently, creating new constraints and opportunities.

## Theoretical Foundations

The game design draws from multiple theoretical frameworks:

### Complexity Theory
- Emergent behavior from simple rules
- Non-linear dynamics and phase transitions
- Network effects and system interdependencies

### Climate Science
- Extreme event attribution
- Climate system feedbacks
- Uncertainty and scenario planning

### Political Economy
- Institutional analysis
- Power dynamics and decision-making
- Collective action problems

### Game Design Theory
- Serious games for learning
- Simulation and modeling
- Player agency and meaningful choices
