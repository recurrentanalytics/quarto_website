# Tipping Points

A strategic card game exploring the intersection of climate science and political systems.

## Overview

*Tipping Points* is a card-based game that models how climate events interact with political and social systems. Players navigate cascading effects, feedback loops, and the challenge of building resilience in the face of uncertainty.

## Game Components

::: {.card}
### Climate Cards
Represent physical climate events: heatwaves, floods, droughts, sea-level rise, and extreme weather patterns.
:::

::: {.card}
### System Cards
Model political, economic, and social systems: governance structures, markets, infrastructure, and communities.
:::

### Tipping Point Cards
Trigger cascading effects when certain conditions are met, creating feedback loops and system transformations.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Each player receives a hand of system cards representing different sectors (energy, agriculture, governance, etc.)
2. **Climate Events**: Draw climate cards that trigger impacts on systems
3. **Response**: Play system cards to build resilience or adapt
4. **Tipping Points**: When thresholds are crossed, tipping point cards activate, changing the game state
5. **Victory Conditions**: Win by maintaining system stability or by successfully transforming systems to be more resilient

## Design Philosophy

The game is designed to:
- Make abstract climate–politics interactions tangible
- Show how small changes can trigger large-scale transformations
- Explore trade-offs between short-term stability and long-term adaptation
- Model uncertainty and incomplete information

## Status

*Currently in development. Rules, cards, and mechanics are being refined through playtesting.*

## Resources

- Game design notes and iterations
- Card templates and artwork
- Playtesting results and feedback
- Theoretical foundations (complexity theory, climate science, political economy)
