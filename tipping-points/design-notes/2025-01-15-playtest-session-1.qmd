## Session Overview

**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Players**: 4  
**Duration**: ~90 minutes  
**Version**: v0.1 (initial prototype)

## Participants

- 2 players with game design experience
- 1 player with climate science background
- 1 player new to both domains

## Setup

- Used initial card set: 20 Climate cards, 30 System cards, 10 Tipping Point cards
- Basic rules: 3 rounds, simple victory conditions
- No time limits for turns

## Key Observations

### What Worked

1. **Card Interactions** - Players found the system interconnections intuitive and engaging
2. **Tipping Point Moments** - The threshold-crossing mechanics created memorable "oh no" moments
3. **Strategic Depth** - Multiple viable paths to victory emerged naturally

### Issues Identified

1. **Pacing** - Game felt slow in early rounds before tipping points activated
2. **Information Overload** - Too many system connections to track simultaneously
3. **Victory Conditions** - Unclear when players were close to winning
4. **Card Balance** - Some climate cards felt too powerful, others too weak

## Player Feedback

> "The cascading effects are really satisfying, but I wish I had more control over when they trigger." — Player A

> "I love the concept, but the rules need to be clearer. I wasn't sure if I was playing correctly." — Player B

> "The climate–politics connection is really well done. It feels like real decision-making under uncertainty." — Player C

## Design Implications

### Immediate Changes Needed

1. **Streamline Setup** - Reduce initial card count or simplify first-round mechanics
2. **Clarify Rules** - Add examples and edge case clarifications
3. **Victory Tracking** - Add visual indicators for progress toward victory conditions
4. **Card Rebalancing** - Adjust intensity values and effects

### Future Iterations

- Consider adding a "preparation phase" before climate events
- Explore asymmetric player roles (different sectors, different goals)
- Add more explicit feedback loops between systems

## Next Steps

1. Revise rules document with clarifications
2. Rebalance initial card set
3. Design victory condition tracking system
4. Schedule second playtest with revised mechanics

## Metrics

- Average turn time: ~3 minutes
- Total rounds played: 3
- Tipping points triggered: 2
- Player satisfaction (1-5): 3.5 average
