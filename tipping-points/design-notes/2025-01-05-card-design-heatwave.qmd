description: "Design process and rationale for the Heatwave climate card. Exploring how to model extreme temperature events and their cascading effects on multiple systems."

## Card Concept

The Heatwave card represents extended periods of extreme high temperatures—one of the most visible and impactful climate events. It needs to capture both immediate impacts (energy demand spikes) and longer-term effects (agricultural stress, health systems).

## Design Goals

1. **Realism** - Model actual heatwave impacts on energy, agriculture, health
2. **Gameplay** - Create interesting strategic choices (mitigate vs. adapt)
3. **Interconnections** - Show how one event affects multiple systems
4. **Uncertainty** - Vary intensity and duration to model unpredictability

## Initial Design

### Version 1.0

**Heatwave**  
*Climate Card*

**Intensity**: 4 (moderate)  
**Duration**: 2 rounds

**Effects**:
- Energy system: +3 stress (cooling demand)
- Agriculture: +2 stress (crop stress)
- Health: +1 stress (heat-related illness)

**Cascading**: If Energy stress > 5, trigger "Grid Overload" event

### Issues with V1.0

- Too predictable (fixed effects)
- No player agency (just happens to you)
- Doesn't capture variability of real heatwaves
- Cascading effect too deterministic

## Revised Design

### Version 2.0

**Heatwave**  
*Climate Card*

**Intensity**: 3-5 (variable)  
**Duration**: 1-3 rounds (variable)

**Primary Effects** (choose one):
- **Energy Focus**: +4 Energy stress, +1 Agriculture stress
- **Agriculture Focus**: +3 Agriculture stress, +2 Water stress
- **Health Focus**: +3 Health stress, +1 Infrastructure stress

**Secondary Effects** (if threshold crossed):
- Energy > 5: Rolling blackouts (additional +2 stress next round)
- Agriculture > 4: Crop failure (permanent -1 Agriculture capacity)
- Health > 4: Emergency response (draw extra System card)

**Player Choice**: When Heatwave is drawn, player chooses which system is primary focus (represents regional variation, preparation, or random chance)

### Design Rationale

1. **Variable Intensity/Duration** - Models real-world unpredictability
2. **Player Choice** - Adds agency and strategic depth
3. **Multiple Pathways** - Different heatwaves affect different systems
4. **Cascading Effects** - Threshold-based secondary effects create tension

## Real-World Context

This card is based on:
- European heatwaves (2003, 2018, 2022) - energy demand spikes, agricultural losses
- North American heat domes - infrastructure stress, health impacts
- Research on heatwave attribution and future projections

Key insight: Heatwaves don't just raise temperatures—they stress multiple interconnected systems simultaneously.

## Playtesting Notes

- Players appreciated the choice element
- Variable intensity created uncertainty without feeling random
- Cascading effects felt natural and consequential
- Some players wanted more ways to prepare for heatwaves

## Future Iterations

### Potential Additions

1. **Regional Variants** - Different heatwave cards for different regions
2. **Preparation Cards** - System cards that reduce heatwave impact
3. **Compound Events** - Heatwave + Drought combinations
4. **Adaptation Paths** - Long-term system changes that reduce vulnerability

### Design Questions

- Should heatwaves be more frequent but less intense, or rare but catastrophic?
- How to model heatwave predictability (early warning systems)?
- Should there be "heatwave seasons" that increase probability?

## Card Art Concepts

- Abstract: Temperature gradient (red to orange)
- Realistic: Satellite imagery of heat patterns
- Stylized: Thermometer breaking, sun icon with intensity markers

*Art direction pending—focusing on mechanics first.*
